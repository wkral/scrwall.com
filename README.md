Scrwall
=======

This is a project for sharing a collection of items all at once, the idea being
that you could share a whole collection of images links at once and present
them in a nice way.

Not much has happened with this project it's still running on the free version
of google app engine, but it's not really being worked on.

There is some pretty interesting js code in the way the images are laid out
and presented to the user. I wrote about some of the technical challenges over
at [scrwall.tumblr.com](http://scrwall.tumblr.com) or check out the source
code.

Perhaps someone will be able to use this in a project of their own.
